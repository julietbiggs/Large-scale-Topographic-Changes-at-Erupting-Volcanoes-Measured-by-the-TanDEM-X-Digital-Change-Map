Supplementary File 1 is an Excel spreadsheet (“DCM_volcano_list.xlsx”). The tab “DCM volcanoes” has a list of volcanoes that erupted within the period covered by the DCM, along with the GPV volcano number, latitude, longitude, whether eruptions occurred during the creation of the EDEM (2010-2015), the assigned quality index, first and last DCM changes, and visible features seen in the DCM. The tab “Statistics” contains a summary of the number of erupting volcanoes, number of eruptions, quality of data, and visible volcanic features seen within the DCM. The tab “No change” contains those volcanoes that do not show any visible topographic change (which are also included in the tab “DCM volcanoes”), and the tab “Statistics (no change)” contains a summary of these volcanoes. 

Supplementary File 2 is a PDF (“DCM_volcano_images.pdf”) that contains annotated screenshots of the DCM.  

Supplementary File 3 is an Excel spreadsheet (“Harmony_priority_lists.xlsx”) containing lists of the high, medium, and low priority recommendations of target volcanoes for the upcoming Harmony mission. This will need to be updated before the final mission plans. 

Supplementary File 4 is a Keyhole Markup Language file (“Harmony_priority_lists.xlsx”) containing these same high, medium, and low priority volcanoes.
